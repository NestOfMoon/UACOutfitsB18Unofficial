### ABOUT
Unofficial patch to b18 for Rimworld mod "The UAC Kit - Outfits only" from @Chicken Plucker, @Odstriman and @Viceroy.
It's fast reformat so be carefull with it.

It's doesn't contain source folder, yes. Since... it's takes too much effort to put one github repository files into another github respository files.

### Why
I was impatient and wasn't intended to keep it for myself.

### WARNING
This patch is completely unofficial and provided "as is". If you using this product(ie UACOutfitsB18Unofficial) then you agree that author of this repository isn't responsible for any type of damage.

Chicken Plucker & Co, allowed this stuff to be here. But ofcourse they are not responsible for this impatient patch.
